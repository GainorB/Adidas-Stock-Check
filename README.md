# Adidas-Stock-Check

Dependancies:
- Python < 3.0 (I don't fuck with print(""), sorry)
- requests
- tkinter

Useage:
- python StockWindow.py
- Add valid SKU, and hit "Pull Adidas Stock", results will come below
- Remember scroll down for further sizes and a total stock count

Also remember to never pay for an Adidas stock checking software, mine is just as good if not better and its free.

Have fun
